# i2i - AI-to-AI Communication

## Brand Names

### Protocol Name: **MCIP**
**M**ulti-model **C**onsensus and **I**nference **P**rotocol

The formal, RFC-style name for the technical specification.

---

### Product Name: **i2i** (pronounced "eye-to-eye")

**Tagline options:**
- "i2i: When AIs See Eye to Eye"
- "i2i: AI-to-AI Consensus"
- "i2i: Trust Through Agreement"
- "i2i: Multi-Model Truth"

**Why i2i works:**
1. **Double meaning**: "eye-to-eye" (agreement) + "AI-to-AI" (architecture)
2. **Memorable**: Short, easy to say, easy to type
3. **Visual**: Works great as a logo (two eyes, or two "i"s facing each other)
4. **Technical credibility**: Evokes "i18n", "i2p", and other tech naming conventions
